Finally I gave up laziness and decided to document and organize my notes throughout my journey in learning Data Science skills. 

I intend to gather info around topics including but not limited to:

machine learning models
Feature engineering
model testing and tuning
Application of different ML/DL techniques in different fields
Many of us search the web to find their answers, read it and move on it, and when the question rise again you need to go through the same hassle. This is one of my motivations to write here, so I will not lose track of gathering valuable knowledge and maybe can be useful for someone else in the world wide web too.

My plan is to populate this blog alongside of learning new topics and doing new experiments.

I commit to myself to try my best to be accurate and referencing any piece of info I mention here.

Let's get started...Shall we?
