Finally I gave up laziness and decided to document and organize my notes throughout my journey in learning Data Science skills. 

I intend to gather info around topics including but not limited to:

* Machine learning models
* Feature engineering
* Model testing and tuning
* Application of different ML/DL techniques in different fields

Many of us search the web to find information, read and then move on it, and when the need rises again you need to go through the same hassle. This is why I decided to write here, so I keep track of gathering valuable knowledge which can also be useful for others.

My plan is to populate this blog alongside of learning new topics and doing new experiments.

I commit to myself to try my best to be accurate and to cite any piece of info I mention here.

Let's get started...Shall we?
