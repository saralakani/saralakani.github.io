Anomaly detection Algorithms works best with Gausssian data, so if we plot our data and see it is not Gaaussian, we can use various transformations to transform them into Gaussian distribution data. Examples of transformation are
* Log transform _xNew=log(x or x+C)_
* root transform _xNew=(x)^(1/2 0r 1/3, etc)_

Error analysis: when observing that algorithm cannot correctly
