# Topics tha I want to cover here are:

* ML Model testing and tuning
* Feature engineering
* Supervised models examples (classification, regression)
* Unsupervised models examples (isolation forest, clusering algorithms)
* Tree based models (Randome forest, Stochastic gradient boostig, extreme gradient boosting, decision tree, extra tree, regularized greedy forest)
* Generalized linear models
* Discriminant models (LDA, MDA, FDA, QDA)
